ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Aymen, currently pursuing a Master's in Bioinformatics at Northeastern University, specializing in computational and systems biology. My journey has been deeply rooted in clinical genomics and data science, where I thrive on turning complex biological data into actionable insights.

Core Expertise: I've honed my skills in high-throughput sequence analysis and RNAseq pipelines, not to mention my knack for predictive modeling. Iâ€™m pretty handy with Python and R, especially with libraries like Pandas, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn, all of which help me tackle big bioinformatics challenges and machine learning projects.

Key Projects: I've taken the lead on several exciting projects, including a comprehensive meta-analysis of CRISPR and gene editing datasets, high-resolution de novo transcriptome assembly, and detailed studies on viral protein localization. Each project has sharpened my ability to integrate and illuminate complex data, revealing intricate disease mechanisms.

My Goal: I'm all about using computational precision to unlock new insights into disease progression, with a particular focus on pushing forward bioinformatics research in oncology and genomics. My aim is to innovate and inspire in the field, making a tangible impact on how we understand and treat diseases.
