Hey there! I'm Aymen, wrapping up my Master's in Bioinformatics at Northeastern University with a focus on computational and systems biology. My academic and professional journey is deeply anchored in clinical genomics and data science, where I’ve developed a passion for making sense of complex biological data and translating it into meaningful insights.

**What I Bring:** Over time, I’ve sharpened my expertise in high-throughput sequencing workflows, RNA-seq analysis, and CRISPR data interpretation. My toolbox includes Python and R, with extensive use of libraries like Pandas, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn to tackle problems that intersect bioinformatics and machine learning. Predictive modeling and data visualization are where I thrive the most.

**Projects That Drive Me**: I've had the chance to lead some impactful projects—ranging from meta-analyses of CRISPR datasets to de novo transcriptome assembly and viral protein localization studies. Each of these projects pushed me to integrate complex datasets and uncover the finer details of disease mechanisms. These experiences have solidified my commitment to pushing boundaries in computational biology.

My ultimate goal is to use bioinformatics to unravel the complexities of disease progression, especially in oncology and genomics. I aim to contribute to research that bridges computational precision with real-world impact, whether it’s through discovering novel insights or building tools that transform how we approach human health.
